The music included with Doodle Bob is by myself, Matt Marchant, created over the last decade or
so. The music may be freely distributed and even used in other projects, although I would appreciate
any credits, embedded in the files or otherwise, remain in tact.

Bob loves to listen to all kinds of music, so if you prefer something of your own simply delete the
existing files (or not!) and copy your own music to this folder. As long as they are in .ogg format
Bob will include them in his playlist. The total number of tracks included in Bob's playlist grows
as you buy more music for him, so if you don't hear your favourite track right away be patient - or
dig deep!
